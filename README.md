Summer 2024 Fin 510: Introduction to Finance (Sections 2-5)
July 1 2024 – August 15 2024
Online Course Through Canvas

Course DescriptionStudents   will learn in   this class   how   the decisions of   a company affect shareholder   value and   what   decisions   can   increase   it.   To   understand   the   perspectives   of shareholders,   we   will   study   basic   principles   of investing:   time   value   of money,   introduction   to   the   valuation   of debt   and   equity   securities, discounted cash flow as a foundation for stock prices, the impact of   diversification and   leverage on portfolio risk, the relationship between risk and expected return in securities markets,   and capital   market efficiency. We   will   use   these   principles   to analyze capital investment decisions   by   estimating   cash   flows   and   discounting   them   at   the   appropriate   cost   of capital.   We   will   also   study how   shareholder   value   is   affected   by   a   firm’s   financing   decisions,   such   as   the   choice   of   using debt or equity capital.
High-Level Learning Objectives:
1)      to establish the terminology and tool-box of   modern financial theory, and
2)      to develop the ability to analyze financial decisions.
3)      by the end of   this course, you should be able to:
a.       Evaluate projects and   make investment decisions based on data
b.       Understand how corporate decisions impact firm value
c.       Understand the basics of   Discontinued Cash Flow (DCF)
